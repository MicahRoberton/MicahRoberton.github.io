# Podcast-1

You can access the site at https://micahroberton.github.io/

The very first site for my podcast was intentionally made with outdated UI and UX. This was done so that I could have a low starting place with the project and imediately be able to improve the site no matter what I add or changed. I wanted to show that starting a podcast can be easy and doesn't need a ton of bells a whistles to get the ball rolling. 

Micah and Duncan get into Theodore Roosevelt and George Washington's lack of approach to racism, the heroic age of arctic expeditions, and other ramblings.

This temporary website is brought to you by divshot's geo-bootstrap, thank you.
