** UX Designer (Prototyper, Product Management)** (July 2020 - October 2020)

I handled day to day tasks while inputting my daily work schedule to report my work digitally from home due to COVID. I helped with design work alongside front end development when necassary.

- Helped take mobile application slides from another firm and *turned them into a working prototype for a client to show off to investors**.
- Came up with logo idea that ended up becoming the startup's Logo
- Created tons of my own Framer and Figma prototypes for mock-clients to improve my application design skills.
- Formulated and reiterated a social media campaign for the firm to expand marketing and client base.
